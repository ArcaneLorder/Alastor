<p>openssl-threads - Overview of thread safety in OpenSSL</p>
<p>
</p>
<hr />
<h1><a name="description">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p>In this man page, we use the term <strong>thread-safe</strong> to indicate that an
object or function can be used by multiple threads at the same time.</p>
<p>OpenSSL can be built with or without threads support. The most important
use of this support is so that OpenSSL itself can use a single consistent
API, as shown in <em>CRYPTO_THREAD_run_once(3)/EXAMPLES</em>.
Multi-platform applications can also use this API.</p>
<p>In particular, being configured for threads support does not imply that
all OpenSSL objects are thread-safe.
To emphasize: <em>most objects are not safe for simultaneous use</em>.
Exceptions to this should be documented on the specific manual pages, and
some general high-level guidance is given here.</p>
<p>One major use of the OpenSSL thread API is to implement reference counting.
Many objects within OpenSSL are reference-counted, so resources are not
released, until the last reference is removed.
References are often increased automatically (such as when an <strong>X509</strong>
certificate object is added into an <strong>X509_STORE</strong> trust store).
There is often an <strong><em>object</em>_up_ref</strong>() function that can be used to increase
the reference count.
Failure to match <strong><em>object</em>_up_ref</strong>() calls with the right number of
<strong><em>object</em>_free</strong>() calls is a common source of memory leaks when a program
exits.</p>
<p>Many objects have set and get API's to set attributes in the object.
A <code>set0</code> passes ownership from the caller to the object and a
<code>get0</code> returns a pointer but the attribute ownership
remains with the object and a reference to it is returned.
A <code>set1</code> or <code>get1</code> function does not change the ownership, but instead
updates the attribute's reference count so that the object is shared
between the caller and the object; the caller must free the returned
attribute when finished.
Functions that involve attributes that have reference counts themselves,
but are named with just <code>set</code> or <code>get</code> are historical; and the documentation
must state how the references are handled.
Get methods are often thread-safe as long as the ownership requirements are
met and shared objects are not modified.
Set methods, or modifying shared objects, are generally not thread-safe
as discussed below.</p>
<p>Objects are thread-safe
as long as the API's being invoked don't modify the object; in this
case the parameter is usually marked in the API as <code>const</code>.
Not all parameters are marked this way.
Note that a <code>const</code> declaration does not mean immutable; for example
<em>X509_cmp(3)</em> takes pointers to <code>const</code> objects, but the implementation
uses a C cast to remove that so it can lock objects, generate and cache
a DER encoding, and so on.</p>
<p>Another instance of thread-safety is when updates to an object's
internal state, such as cached values, are done with locks.
One example of this is the reference counting API's described above.</p>
<p>In all cases, however, it is generally not safe for one thread to
mutate an object, such as setting elements of a private or public key,
while another thread is using that object, such as verifying a signature.</p>
<p>The same API's can usually be used simultaneously on different objects
without interference.
For example, two threads can calculate a signature using two different
<strong>EVP_PKEY_CTX</strong> objects.</p>
<p>For implicit global state or singletons, thread-safety depends on the facility.
The <em>CRYPTO_secure_malloc(3)</em> and related API's have their own lock,
while <em>CRYPTO_malloc(3)</em> assumes the underlying platform allocation
will do any necessary locking.
Some API's, such as <em>NCONF_load(3)</em> and related, or <em>OBJ_create(3)</em>
do no locking at all; this can be considered a bug.</p>
<p>A separate, although related, issue is modifying &quot;factory&quot; objects
when other objects have been created from that.
For example, an <strong>SSL_CTX</strong> object created by <em>SSL_CTX_new(3)</em> is used
to create per-connection <strong>SSL</strong> objects by calling <em>SSL_new(3)</em>.
In this specific case, and probably for factory methods in general, it is
not safe to modify the factory object after it has been used to create
other objects.</p>
